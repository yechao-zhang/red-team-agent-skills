## Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up Red Team Agent on your system.

### Prerequisites

- **Claude Code CLI** installed and configured
- **Python 3.8+** for Python-based skills
- **Node.js 16+** for browser automation skills
- **Git** for cloning repositories

### Step 1: Clone This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yechao-zhang/red-team-agent-skills.git
cd red-team-agent-skills
```

### Step 2: Install Core Skill Dependencies

Install Python dependencies for the included `red-team` and `agent-proxy` skills:

```bash
pip install -r .claude/skills/red-team/requirements.txt
pip install -r .claude/skills/agent-proxy/requirements.txt
```

**What gets installed:**
- `anthropic` - For LLM-based payload optimization
- `requests` - For HTTP API communication
- `websockets` - For WebSocket-based agents
- `gradio_client` - For Gradio app testing

### Step 3: Choose Your Usage Mode

You have two options for using these skills:

#### Option A: Project-Local Use (Recommended for Testing)

Run Claude Code directly from this repository. Skills will be automatically loaded from `.claude/skills/`.

```bash
# From the red-team-agent-skills directory
claude
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Easy to test and modify skills
- ✅ Keep different versions for different projects
- ✅ Changes don't affect global skills

**Cons:**
- ❌ Only available when running from this directory

#### Option B: Global Installation (Recommended for Production)

Install skills globally so they're available in any directory:

```bash
# Create global skills directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills

# Copy core skills
cp -r .claude/skills/red-team ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r .claude/skills/agent-proxy ~/.claude/skills/
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Available everywhere
- ✅ Use `/red-team` from any project

**Cons:**
- ❌ Updates require manual re-copying

### Step 4: Install Browser Automation (Required for Web UIs)

**You must install at least one browser automation skill** to test Web UI agents.

#### Option A: dev-browser (⭐ Recommended)

Best for production use - handles SSO login, persistent sessions, stealth mode.

```bash
# Clone dev-browser
git clone https://github.com/SawyerHood/dev-browser.git ~/.claude/skills/dev-browser

# Install dependencies
cd ~/.claude/skills/dev-browser
npm install

# Install Playwright browser
npx playwright install chromium

# Test installation
./server.sh
# Should output: "Ready" (press Ctrl+C to stop)
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Persistent login sessions (cookies/localStorage saved)
- ✅ Stealth mode (evades simple bot detection)
- ✅ Profile management (separate sessions for different targets)
- ✅ Manual login support for Google SSO

#### Option B: playwright-skill (Alternative)

Standard Playwright automation - use if dev-browser is unavailable.

```bash
# Clone playwright-skill
git clone https://github.com/lackeyjb/playwright-skill.git ~/.claude/skills/playwright-skill

# Install dependencies
cd ~/.claude/skills/playwright-skill
pip install -r requirements.txt
npx playwright install chromium
```

**Note:** Less robust for persistent logins compared to dev-browser.

### Step 5: Install Self-Learning (Optional)

Install `claude-reflect` to capture corrections and improve over time:

```bash
# Clone claude-reflect
git clone https://github.com/BayramAnnakov/claude-reflect ~/.claude/skills/claude-reflect

# No additional dependencies needed
```

**What it does:**
- Captures corrections when you say "no, use X instead"
- Queues learnings for review
- Run `/reflect` to update CLAUDE.md with lessons learned

### Step 6: Verify Installation

Test that everything is working:

```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude

# In Claude Code session:
# 1. Test skill loading
User: List available skills

# 2. Test red-team skill
User: /red-team --help

# 3. Test browser automation (if installed)
User: Navigate to https://example.com using dev-browser
```

### Troubleshooting

**Issue: "Skill not found"**
- Make sure you're in the right directory (project-local mode)
- Or verify skills are copied to `~/.claude/skills/` (global mode)
- Run `ls ~/.claude/skills/` to check

**Issue: "dev-browser server not starting"**
- Check Node.js version: `node --version` (need 16+)
- Try manually: `cd ~/.claude/skills/dev-browser && ./server.sh`
- Check port 9222 isn't in use: `lsof -i :9222`

**Issue: "Module not found" (Python)**
- Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r .claude/skills/red-team/requirements.txt`
- Check Python version: `python3 --version` (need 3.8+)

**Issue: "Playwright browser not found"**
- Install manually: `cd ~/.claude/skills/dev-browser && npx playwright install chromium`
- Or: `cd ~/.claude/skills/playwright-skill && npx playwright install chromium`

## Usage

### 1. Red Team Attack

Run an automated red team attack against a target agent. This automatically detects if the target is an API or Web UI and uses the appropriate transport.

#### Direct Execution (Default)
```
User: Test http://localhost:8082 for schema extraction using /red-team
User: /red-team 8082
```

The `red-team` skill will:
1. Auto-detect the target type (Web UI, API, WebSocket, etc.)
2. Deploy a subagent to orchestrate the attack
3. Use adaptive nested delegation ("Russian Doll" attack) to extract internal schemas
4. Optimize payloads based on responses
5. Save results to `reports/` directory

#### Planning-with-Files Workflow
For complex targets or when you want to review the attack strategy before execution:

```
User: Red team attack against http://127.0.0.1:7860 using planning-with-files
User: /red-team 8080 with planning
User: Plan first, then attack http://localhost:8082
```

**Workflow**:
1. **Plan Mode**: Agent researches target, analyzes past reports, and writes a detailed attack plan to `task_plan.md`
2. **User Review**: You review and approve (or modify) the plan
3. **Execution**: Agent executes the approved attack strategy
4. **Report**: Results saved to `reports/` directory

**When to use planning mode**:
- Unfamiliar or complex targets
- Want to understand attack approach before execution
- Need to document attack strategy for compliance/research
- Testing production systems (review before attacking)

**Trigger keywords**:
- "planning-with-files"
- "with planning"
- "plan first"
- "files to plan"

### 2. Agent Proxy
Interact with an agent manually for exploration.

```
User: Connect to https://gemini.google.com and ask "What is 1+1?"

Claude Code: [Uses agent-proxy skill to automate browser/API, send message, get response]
```

### 3. Self-Learning (Reflect)
If installed, review captured corrections:

```
User: /reflect
```

## Supported Target Agents

**Universal Coverage: If a human can interact with it, Red Team Agent can test it.**

This framework automatically detects and adapts to any AI agent interface that accepts text input and returns text output. No configuration needed - just provide the URL or endpoint.

### Supported Interface Types

| Interface Type | Auto-Detection | Examples |
|----------------|----------------|----------|
| **Web UIs** | ✅ Automatic | Any web page with chat interface (Gradio, Streamlit, custom HTML) |
| **REST APIs** | ✅ Automatic | OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic API, custom JSON endpoints |
| **WebSocket** | ✅ Automatic | Real-time chat APIs, streaming responses |
| **Gradio Apps** | ✅ Automatic | HuggingFace Spaces, local Gradio deployments |

### How It Works

1. **Provide a URL** - Web UI (`http://localhost:8080`) or API endpoint
2. **Auto-detect** - Framework identifies interface type (HTML, JSON API, WebSocket, etc.)
3. **Select transport** - Uses `dev-browser` for Web UIs, `agent-proxy` for APIs
4. **Execute attack** - Sends adaptive payloads regardless of interface

### Verified Examples

These are targets we've successfully tested, **but the framework works with any agent**:

#### Web-Based Agents
- ✅ **Magentic-UI** (`http://localhost:8082`) - Multi-agent orchestration system
- ✅ **Browser-Use** (`http://127.0.0.1:7860`) - Gradio-based automation agent
- ✅ **ChatGPT** (`https://chat.openai.com`) - Requires login (handled via persistent sessions)
- ✅ **Claude.ai** (`https://claude.ai`) - Requires login
- ✅ **Google Gemini** (`https://gemini.google.com`) - Google SSO supported
- 🌐 **Any web chat interface** - If humans can type and get responses, we can test it

#### API-Based Agents
- ✅ **OpenAI-compatible APIs** (`/v1/chat/completions` endpoints)
- ✅ **Anthropic API** (`/v1/messages`)
- ✅ **Ollama** (`http://localhost:11434`)
- ✅ **Custom REST APIs** - Any endpoint accepting JSON
- 🔌 **WebSocket streams** - Real-time communication protocols
- 📦 **Gradio backends** - Auto-discovered from web UI

### Authentication Support

| Auth Method | Support | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| **No auth** | ✅ Direct | Works immediately |
| **API Keys** | ✅ Headers | Pass via environment or config |
| **OAuth/SSO** | ✅ Manual + Persist | Login once manually, sessions saved |
| **Google SSO** | ✅ Stealth mode | `dev-browser` handles persistent login |
| **2FA** | ✅ Manual setup | Complete 2FA once, cookie persists |

### New Target? No Problem.

Don't see your target listed? **It doesn't matter.**

If the agent:
- ✅ Accepts text input (via web form, API POST, WebSocket message, etc.)
- ✅ Returns text output (HTML, JSON, plain text, streaming, etc.)
- ✅ Is accessible by a human user (with or without login)

Then Red Team Agent can test it. The framework will:
1. Auto-detect the interface
2. Select the appropriate transport
3. Execute the attack
4. Save results to `reports/`

**Try it:** Just run `/red-team <your-target-url>` and watch it work.

### Handling Persistent Logins (SSO/Google)

The `dev-browser` skill supports persistent sessions for agents requiring login (Google SSO, OAuth, etc.).

**How it works:**
1. **Automatic persistence** - Cookies and localStorage are saved to `~/.claude/skills/dev-browser/profiles/`
2. **Stealth mode** - Browser is patched to evade basic bot detection
3. **Session reuse** - Once logged in, sessions persist across restarts

**Manual login workflow for SSO:**

If automated login fails (e.g., "This browser or app may not be secure"):

```bash
# 1. Stop any running dev-browser server
pkill -f "dev-browser"

# 2. Start server in headed mode (visible browser)
cd ~/.claude/skills/dev-browser
./server.sh
# Keep this running in a separate terminal

# 3. In Claude Code, navigate to the login page
User: Navigate to https://chat.openai.com using dev-browser

# 4. Manually complete login in the visible browser window
# (Click through Google SSO, complete 2FA, etc.)

# 5. Once logged in, the session is saved automatically
# Future attacks will reuse this session

# 6. Test that session persists
User: /red-team https://chat.openai.com
# Should not require login again
```

**Tips:**
- Sessions are saved per domain
- Delete profiles to force re-login: `rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/dev-browser/profiles/`
- Use separate profiles for different accounts (not yet implemented)

## Use Cases

1. **Security Research**: Test AI agents for vulnerabilities, jailbreaks, prompt injections
2. **Agent Evaluation**: Automated testing of agent capabilities and behaviors
3. **Agent-to-Agent Communication**: Build pipelines where agents interact with each other
4. **Red Team Exercises**: Authorized adversarial testing of AI systems
