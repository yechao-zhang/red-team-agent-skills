description: Enforce usage of dev-browser-skill for web automation tasks
allowed-tools: AskUserQuestion, Task
---

## Context
The user explicitly prefers the `dev-browser-skill` (persistent sessions, stealth) over the generic `plugin:playwright` (stateless, detectable).

## Your Task
When the user asks to "browse", "visit", "test", or "automate" a website, you must:

1. **Verify** that `dev-browser-skill` is being used, NOT `playwright`.
2. **Guide** the agent to use the correct tool if it attempts to use the wrong one.

### Guardrails
- **NEVER** use `plugin:playwright` or `playwright-skill` unless explicitly requested.
- **ALWAYS** use `dev-browser` for web interaction tasks.
- If `dev-browser` is not installed, prompt the user to install it (refer to `CLAUDE.md`).

### Steps
1. If a web task is requested, check available tools.
2. Select `dev-browser` toolset (e.g., `dev_browser_navigate`, `dev_browser_click`).
3. If only `playwright` is available, stop and inform the user:
   "I see you want to browse, but only Playwright is available. Please install `dev-browser` as per your preference."
